# automatic-plant-watering-esp8266-domain-localhost-IoT
 An ESP8266-based automated irrigation system that activates watering when soil moisture falls below a user-defined threshold. The PHP-based interface allows real-time monitoring of soil moisture, ambient humidity, and ambient temperature. Users can set the minimum soil moisture and ambient humidity thresholds for automatic watering. Additionally, manual watering can be triggered via a button, and automatic watering can be enabled or disabled as needed. The system also logs watering events and records environmental data every 20 minutes for review.
